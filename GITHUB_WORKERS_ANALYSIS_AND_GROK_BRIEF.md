## Current GitHub Worker Status

### Active Sources (from gdelt-obsidian repo)

| Source | File Count | Last Activity | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Arxiv_Notes** | 524 | Aug 20 | ⚠️ Stale (4+ months) |
| **YouTube_Notes** | 741 | Feb 27 | ⚠️ Stale (9+ months) |
| **News_Notes** | 27 | Aug 20 | ⚠️ Stale (4+ months) |
| **GitHub_Trending_Notes** | 29 | Aug 20 | ⚠️ Stale (4+ months) |
| **HackerNews_Notes** | 16 | Aug 20 | ⚠️ Stale (4+ months) |
| **OWID_Notes** | 8 | Aug 20 | ⚠️ Stale (4+ months) |
| **GDELT_Notes** | 44 | May 30 | ❌ Disabled (cost) |

### Key Findings

1. **All GitHub scrapers appear dormant** - Last activity 4-9 months ago
2. **GDELT deliberately disabled** - BigQuery costs ($112/month) exceeded free tier
3. **2,170 GitHub documents** in database but not actively refreshing
4. **Manual Obsidian clippings** are the primary fresh content source

### Content Quality Analysis

**From recent cleaning session:**
- Obsidian clippings: 40-98% noise reduction needed (web clipper pollution)
- GitHub sources: Unknown (stale data, can't assess current quality)
- **Opportunity**: Reactivate workers or find replacement sources

   - Deduplication strategy (same news from multiple sources)

### Success Criteria

**This research is successful if it enables:**

1. **Automatic detection** of commercial biotech milestones within 24 hours of announcement
2. **Proactive discovery** of emerging companies before they're widely known
3. **Reduced manual clipping** by automating 80%+ of high-quality content discovery

5. **Diverse content mix** (40% research, 40% commercial, 20% market/investment)

### Research Constraints

- **Focus on English-language sources** (can expand later)
- **Prioritize free/low-cost channels** (sub-$100/month total)
- **Emphasize sources with APIs/RSS** over scraping-required sources
- **Skip consumer health/wellness** (focus on industrial/research applications)
- **Avoid hype/speculation** (focus on demonstrated results)

### Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Entity discovery + Top 20 channels
- **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Keyword expansion + Query library
- **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Channel integration testing + Monitoring dashboard design
