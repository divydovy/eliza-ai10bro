# 📊 AI10bro Broadcast Status Dashboard

A real-time dashboard to monitor the status of your ElizaOS broadcast system.

## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Statistics**: View total documents, broadcasts, and their status
- **Coverage Metrics**: See how many documents have broadcasts vs pending
- **Status Breakdown**: Monitor pending, sent, and failed broadcasts
- **Recent Activity**: Live feed of recent broadcast activity
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with gradient colors

## 📈 Dashboard Metrics

### Current Stats (from your database):
- **1,439 documents** in knowledge base
- **3,858 broadcast messages** created
- **1,013 documents** with broadcasts
- **426 documents** awaiting broadcast creation
- **70% coverage** of documents

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Easy Method:
```bash
# Run the start script
./start-dashboard.sh
```

The dashboard will automatically:
1. Start the API server
2. Open your browser to the dashboard
3. Begin showing real-time stats

### Manual Method:
```bash
# Start the API server
BROADCAST_API_PORT=3002 node broadcast-api-simple.js

# Open dashboard in browser
open http://localhost:3002/broadcast-dashboard.html
```

## 🔧 Architecture

### Components:
1. **broadcast-dashboard.html** - Interactive web dashboard
2. **broadcast-api-simple.js** - Lightweight Node.js API server
3. **SQLite Database** - Your existing ElizaOS database

### How It Works:
- API server connects to your `agent/data/db.sqlite` database
- Queries broadcast messages and document statistics
- Serves data via HTTP endpoints
- Dashboard fetches and displays data with auto-refresh

## 📊 API Endpoints

- `http://localhost:3002/broadcast-dashboard.html` - Dashboard UI
- `http://localhost:3002/api/broadcast-stats` - JSON statistics
- `http://localhost:3002/health` - Health check

## 🎨 Dashboard Sections

### Stats Grid
- Total Documents
- Total Broadcasts  
- Pending Broadcasts
- Sent Broadcasts
- Documents Without Broadcasts
- Broadcast Coverage %

### Recent Activity Feed
- Shows last 20 broadcasts
- Platform indicators (Telegram/Twitter)
- Status indicators (pending/sent/failed)
- Time since creation

## 💡 Key Insights

Based on your data:
- All 3,858 broadcasts are currently marked as "pending"
- This suggests broadcasts are created but not marked as "sent" after delivery
- 70% of documents have associated broadcasts
- Average of ~3.8 broadcasts per document (likely Telegram + Twitter for each)

## 🔍 Database Schema

The dashboard queries your ElizaOS database:
```sql
-- Documents
SELECT * FROM memories WHERE type = 'documents'

-- Broadcasts  
SELECT * FROM memories 
WHERE type = 'messages' 
AND json_extract(content, '$.metadata.messageType') = 'broadcast'
```

## 🛠 Customization

Edit `broadcast-dashboard.html` to:
- Change refresh interval (currently 30 seconds)
- Modify color scheme
- Add new metrics
- Customize activity display

## 📝 Next Steps

To enhance the dashboard further:
1. Add platform-specific stats (Telegram vs Twitter)
2. Include hourly/daily broadcast trends
3. Add filtering by date range
4. Export statistics to CSV
5. Add broadcast search functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
- The script automatically tries port 3003 if 3002 is busy
- Or manually specify: `BROADCAST_API_PORT=3004 node broadcast-api-simple.js`

**Database not found?**
- Ensure ElizaOS has been run and created the database
- Check path: `agent/data/db.sqlite`

**No data showing?**
- Verify broadcasts exist in your database
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure API server is running

## 🎉 Success!

Your broadcast dashboard is now ready to use! Monitor your AI agent's broadcast activity in real-time with beautiful visualizations.
