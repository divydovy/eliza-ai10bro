## 🎯 ONE-SENTENCE PITCH

"AI10BRO is an automated biotech intelligence platform that tracks 117 entities across 58 RSS feeds, detects deal signals in real-time, and produces structured data products—exactly what PEI does for PE/VC, but automated and focused on biotech."

---

## 💡 THE THREE VALUE PROPS

1. **Immediate Value**: Add biotech vertical to PEI (117 entities, Day 1)
2. **Technology Transfer**: Apply AI automation to PEI's other verticals (infrastructure, real estate, secondaries)
3. **Market Timing**: First-mover in automated biotech intelligence ($20B+ deal flow in 2023)

---

## 🚀 THE ROADMAP IN 30 SECONDS

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Content hub - COMPLETE (entity DB, RSS automation, LLM scoring, 15 services operational)
- **Phase 2 (3-6mo)**: Rich entity profiles (company/lab/VC profiles, deal flow dashboard, relationship mapping)
- **Phase 3 (6-12mo)**: Full platform (screeners, analytics, subscriptions, API)
- **With PEI**: Accelerate Phase 2 to 2-3 months (vs 6 solo), revenue by 2025

## ⚙️ TECH STACK IN 3 BULLETS

1. **ElizaOS + Qwen2.5-32B**: Autonomous agent framework + local GPT-4-equivalent LLM (zero costs)
2. **15 LaunchD Services**: RSS discovery, LLM scoring, broadcast creation, distribution (100% automated)
3. **Multi-Platform**: Telegram, Bluesky, WordPress (5 active channels, API-ready for PEI integration)

---

## 🔢 COST EFFICIENCY

- **Current**: ~$5/mo (WordPress hosting only)
- **Phase 2**: ~$50/mo (PostgreSQL hosting)
- **Phase 3**: ~$500/mo (production hosting, CDN)
- **Zero LLM vendor lock-in** (local inference, no OpenAI bills)

Compare to: Manual analyst = $80-120K/year

---

## 📈 TRACTION PROOF POINTS

- **21,155 documents** processed (not a prototype)
- **15 services** operational 24/7 (production-grade)
- **51% entity mention rate** (validates commercial focus)
- **79% LLM scored** (quality-filtered)
- **36% auto-discovery** (machine finds feeds, not humans)

---

## 🎯 THE ASK (FINAL SLIDE)

"I'm proposing an acquisition. You get:
1. Working platform (15 services, 100% uptime)
2. 117-entity database (ready to monetize Day 1)
3. Full codebase + deployment automation
4. Founder joins PEI team (that's me)

Open to negotiation on structure: acquisition, partnership, or joint venture."

---

## 🤔 ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: What's your valuation?**
A: "Open to discussion. Biotech data companies typically exit at 5-10x ARR. We're pre-revenue but have proven tech. Let's talk about what makes sense for both sides."

**Q: Why not raise VC funding?**
A: "I could. But PEI offers distribution, brand, and adjacent verticals to scale this tech. It's a better strategic fit than going solo."

**Q: What role post-acquisition?**
A: "Product lead for PEI BioIntelligence. Own the roadmap, build the team, integrate with your platforms. I'm an operator, not just a founder."

**Q: How do you validate scientific claims?**
A: "We track mentions, not opinions. If Ginkgo announces Series E, we detect it. We're not judging science—we're tracking commercial signals."

**Q: Can this scale to other verticals?**
A: "Absolutely. Same system, different RSS feeds. Infrastructure deals? Real estate? Secondaries? The entity tracking and deal signal detection work for any industry."

## 🏁 CLOSING (30 SECONDS)

"So to recap: AI10BRO is production-grade, cost-efficient, and perfectly aligned with PEI's business model. You have the distribution and brand. We have the technology and corpus. Together, we launch PEI BioIntelligence in Q2 2025. I'm open to discussing terms, integration timeline, and how this fits into PEI's strategic roadmap. Ready to move forward?"
