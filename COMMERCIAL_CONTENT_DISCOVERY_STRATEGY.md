## Content Source Deduplication Strategy

### Remove/Deprioritize Research-Heavy Sources
- ❌ **bioRxiv** - Early-stage research (keep for discovery, low priority)
- ❌ **medRxiv** - Medical preprints (deprioritize)
- ⬇️ **Nature News** - Reduce frequency (keep but lower priority)
- ⬇️ **Science Daily** - Reduce frequency

### Keep Academic Sources for Discovery
- ✅ **Nature Biotechnology** - High-impact only
- ✅ **Cell Systems** - Systems biology
- ✅ **ACS Synthetic Biology** - Synthetic biology

---

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1: High-Signal Commercial Sources
- Add 10 Tier 1 sources
- Expected: +20 articles/day, 80%+ commercial signal

### Week 2: Regional & Sector-Specific
- Add 10 Tier 2 sources
- Expected: +10 articles/day, sector depth

### Week 3: Automation & Filtering
- Set up RSS feed prioritization (commercial > research)
- Adjust LLM scoring weights (boost commercial keywords)
- Create "commercial_stage" entity in search_config.yml

---

## Expected Impact

### Before (Current Mix)
- Research: 60%
- Commercial: 30%
- Other: 10%

### After (Optimized Mix)
- Research: 20%
- Commercial: 70% ⭐
- Other: 10%

### Content Volume
- Current: ~50 articles/day
- After: ~70 articles/day (+40%)
- Commercial articles: 15/day → 50/day (+233%) ⭐

### Commercial Signal Keywords to Boost
- Series B, Series C, fundraising, IPO
- Product launch, market entry, first customer
- Partnership, licensing, acquisition
- FDA approval, GRAS status, EPA registration
- Revenue, sales, commercialization
- Scale-up, manufacturing, pilot facility

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add Tier 1 sources (10 RSS feeds)
2. **This Week**: Update LLM scoring to boost commercial keywords
3. **Next Week**: Add Tier 2 sources (10 RSS feeds)
4. **Month 1**: Create commercial_stage entity for targeted searching
5. **Month 2**: Patent tracker integration (Google Patents API)
6. **Month 3**: Newsletter/Substack aggregation

**Goal**: 70% commercial content within 2 weeks
