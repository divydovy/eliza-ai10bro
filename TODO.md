# TODO - Eliza AI10BRO Broadcast System

## Current Status (2025-09-23)
-  Broadcast system fully operational with multi-platform support
-  Automated scheduling via cron (hourly sending, 4-hour generation)
-  Dashboard monitoring at http://localhost:3002/broadcast-dashboard.html
-  Comprehensive documentation in BROADCAST_SYSTEM.md
-  Prompt variations reducing formulaic content

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Monitor broadcast quality over next 24 hours
- [ ] Verify cron jobs are executing properly
- [ ] Check that all 3 platforms continue receiving broadcasts
- [ ] Review pending broadcast queue for quality

## Near-term Improvements (This Week)
- [ ] Add engagement tracking for broadcasts
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for different prompt styles
- [ ] Create broadcast preview system in dashboard
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sends
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for system failures

## Platform Expansions
- [ ] Twitter/X integration (currently disabled)
- [ ] LinkedIn integration for professional audience
- [ ] Discord webhook integration
- [ ] Mastodon federation support

## Content Enhancements
- [ ] Dynamic prompt adjustment based on engagement metrics
- [ ] Multi-language broadcast support
- [ ] Image generation for visual broadcasts
- [ ] Thread/chain creation for complex topics
- [ ] Topic clustering to avoid repetition

## System Optimizations
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better concurrency
- [ ] Implement Redis queue for broadcast management
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] Create scheduled posting for optimal times per platform
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per platform API

## Dashboard Improvements
- [ ] Add engagement metrics visualization
- [ ] Create broadcast performance analytics
- [ ] Implement broadcast editing/preview before sending
- [ ] Add platform-specific statistics
- [ ] Create broadcast history search/filter

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add automated tests for broadcast generation
- [ ] Implement content moderation checks
- [ ] Create quality scoring system
- [ ] Add duplicate detection before generation
- [ ] Implement source verification system

## Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Create API documentation for broadcast system
- [ ] Write troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document prompt engineering best practices
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines for broadcast improvements
- [ ] Write deployment guide for production environments

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Clean up background processes (multiple instances running)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate API files
- [ ] Standardize error handling across services
- [ ] Add proper logging system with log rotation
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints

## Long-term Vision
- [ ] AI-driven content calendar planning
- [ ] Community-driven broadcast suggestions
- [ ] Cross-platform conversation threading
- [ ] Automated trend detection and rapid response
- [ ] Integration with knowledge graph for contextual broadcasts

## Known Issues to Fix
- [ ] Dashboard shows 1970 dates occasionally (timestamp format issue)
- [ ] Multiple background processes accumulating
- [ ] Cipher MCP not capturing Claude sessions properly
- [ ] Some documents have "test" as source affecting quality

## Performance Metrics to Track
- Current: 24% document coverage (344 of 1460 docs)
- Target: 50% coverage by end of month
- Success rate: >95% for configured platforms
- Generation time: ~2 seconds per broadcast
- Optimal pending queue: 50-100 broadcasts

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Check system status
sqlite3 agent/data/db.sqlite "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM broadcasts GROUP BY status;"

# Manual broadcast trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/trigger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action":"PROCESS_QUEUE"}'

# Generate new broadcasts
node process-unprocessed-docs.js 20

# View cron jobs
crontab -l

# Start dashboard
node packages/plugin-dashboard/src/services/broadcast-api.js &
node packages/plugin-dashboard/src/services/action-api.js &
open http://localhost:3002/broadcast-dashboard.html
```
