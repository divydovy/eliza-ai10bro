# Eliza Project Session Memory

## Session: 2025-08-21

### Project: Eliza AI Agent - Broadcast System

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Successfully pushed broadcast system infrastructure to GitHub**
   - Commit: 2a02571a6
   - Files: 57 files with 5,250 insertions
   - Repository: divydovy/eliza-ai10bro

2. **Completed EOD git commits for multiple projects**
   - Eliza: Core models and broadcast infrastructure
   - Wooify: QR code functionality (commit: e887e02)
   - Woo Analytics: Documentation update (commit: a0a0228)
   - woo-marketplace-gap-analysis: Enhanced analysis (commit: 2c8c8b2)

3. **Resolved GitHub security issues**
   - Excluded SpecStory files containing API keys from commits
   - Used GitHub push protection to prevent secret exposure

4. **Established cipher as persistent memory layer**
   - Set up MCP configuration for file sharing
   - Created shared TODO.md for cross-session continuity

### Technical Decisions
- **Authentication**: Used 1Password SSH agent for git operations
- **Security**: Excluded sensitive SpecStory documentation from public commits
- **Integration**: Established shared file system between Claude Code and cipher

### Current Project State
- ✅ Main Eliza broadcast system deployed to remote repository
- ✅ N8N workflow automation for Telegram integration
- ✅ Dashboard monitoring and batch processing capabilities
- ⚠️ Other repository commits completed locally but not yet pushed

### Architecture Components
- **Broadcast API**: action-api.js, broadcast-api.js
- **Dashboard**: broadcast-dashboard.html with monitoring tools
- **N8N Integration**: Telegram workflow automation
- **Processing Scripts**: Batch processing and content generation
- **Database**: SQLite databases for session and state management

### Next Steps (TODO)
1. Clean up SpecStory files with API keys removed
2. Push remaining project commits to remotes
3. Test broadcast system functionality post-deployment
4. Update project documentation with new infrastructure
5. Set up .gitignore patterns to prevent future API key commits

### Development Environment
- **Git Authentication**: 1Password SSH agent
- **Model Configuration**: Updated to use qwen2.5:14b for Ollama
- **MCP Setup**: Cipher configured with filesystem access to Projects directory
- **Session Storage**: Both cipher and Claude Code can access shared files
