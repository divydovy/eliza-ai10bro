# Grok Research Phase 1: Bio-Innovation Intelligence Network

## Mission
I need you to help me build a comprehensive intelligence network to identify breakthrough bio-innovations, commercial biotech developments, and nature-inspired technologies. This will power an AI agent (AI10BRO) that broadcasts biotech breakthroughs to entrepreneurs and researchers.

## What I Need From You (Phase 1)

### 1. Top 20 Channels for Commercial Biotech News

Please identify the **20 best sources** for tracking commercial biotech milestones (FDA approvals, funding rounds, product launches, 100x scale-ups, clinical trial results).

For each source, provide:

- **Integration method** (RSS feed URL, API, Twitter account, requires scraping)
- **Estimated cost** (free, <$50/mo, <$100/mo, enterprise)
- **Signal-to-noise ratio** (High/Medium/Low - how much biotech vs general tech)
- **Why it's valuable** (1-2 sentences on what makes it essential)

**Prioritize:**
- Sources that publish FIRST (not aggregators)
